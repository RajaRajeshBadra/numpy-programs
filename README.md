# numpy-programs
basic python programs using NUMPY library
1. Using numpy, WAP that takes an input from the user in the form of a list and calculate the
frequency of occurrence of each character/integer in that list (count the number of
characters).

2. Take a binary input form user and segregate all 1's to left side and 0's to right side.

Ex: Input : 1010011 Output : 111100

3. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.

4. Write a Python program to test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a
second array.
Expected Output:
Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60]
Array2: [0, 40]
Compare each element of array1 and array2
[ True False False True False]

5. Write a Python program to find the set exclusive-or of two arrays. Set exclusive-or will
return the sorted, unique values that are in only one (not both) of the input arrays.
Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60 80]
Array2: [10, 30, 40, 50, 70]
Unique values that are in only one (not both) of the input arrays:
[ 0 20 30 50 60 70 80]
